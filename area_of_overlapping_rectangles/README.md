## The task

The task of this chelenge is to determine the area of the overlap between two rectangles when the coordinates of both rectangles are known.

## The solution  

The intersection of two rectangles if they have a common area is also a rectangle, its height and width are determined by the intersection of the coordinates of the length and width of the rectangle whose common area we are looking for.
