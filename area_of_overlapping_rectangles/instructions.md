## Area of Overlapping Rectangles  

Create a function that returns the area of the overlap between two rectangles. The function will receive two rectangles, each with the coordinates of the lower left corner followed by the width and the height rect = [x, y, width, height].  

### Examples  

- overlapping_rectangles([ 2, 1, 3, 4 ], [ 3, 2, 2, 5 ]) ➞ 6  

- overlapping_rectangles([ 2, -9, 11, 5 ], [ 5, -11, 2, 9 ]) ➞ 10  

- overlapping_rectangles([ -8, -7, 4, 7 ],  [-5, -9, 4, 7 ]) ➞ 5
